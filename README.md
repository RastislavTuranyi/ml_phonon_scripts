# ML phonon calculation scripts

This repository is a collection of scripts for running phonon calculations using machine-learned interatomic potentials
(MLIP). It includes scripts for the entire pipeline, from converting CIF files to something more useable, to the 
phonon calculations themselves.

All the scripts are based on top of the [janus-core](https://stfc.github.io/janus-core/index.html) package.
